# RFC-NATIVE-MOBILE — Device apps move from React Native to native

Status: **APPROVED** (owner decision, 2026-09-13). Supersedes the mobile and TV rows of
RFC-HMS-2026-003 TechStack (React Native CLI + Paper v5; React Native for Android TV).

## Decision

Every MedBrains device app is rewritten natively, screen for screen, in lockstep per module:

| Surface family | Platform stack | Design system |
|---|---|---|
| `Mobile-*` on iPhone/iPad | Swift 6, SwiftUI, iOS 17+ (built with the iOS 26 SDK) | Apple Human Interface Guidelines, including *Designing for iPhone Duo*; Liquid Glass through system components |
| `Mobile-*` on Android | Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, `androidx.compose.material3` 1.4 | Material 3 Expressive (`MaterialExpressiveTheme`, `MotionScheme.expressive()`) |
| `TV-*` on Android TV / Google TV | Kotlin, Compose for TV (`androidx.tv.material3`) | 10-foot UI, D-pad focus, overscan |

Carbon stays the brand: colour, type and spacing come from `packages/design-system` tokens,
generated into a Swift `enum Carbon` and a Kotlin `object Carbon`. The layout system is the
platform's, never the web 2x grid.

## Why

- **Speed and control for clinical work.** HealthKit / Health Connect, camera and barcode,
  background sessions, biometrics and secure storage are first-class natively; every one of
  them crossed a bridge before.
- **The Rust core was already native.** `crates/medbrains-edge-rn` (UniFFI 0.31) generates
  Swift and Kotlin bindings today; the React Native binding was the extra layer.
- **The platforms have moved.** iPhone Duo's dual displays and vertical bars, Liquid Glass, and
  Material 3 Expressive are delivered through the platforms' own components; standard SwiftUI
  and Compose containers get them free, a cross-platform kit gets them late or never.

## What does not change

- **The backend.** Native clients send `X-MedBrains-Client: mobile-<variant>` (or `tv-…`),
  which switches login to body tokens (`crates/medbrains-auth/src/lib.rs`), and authenticate
  with a bearer token, which bypasses CSRF. `permissions` are read from the login response
  body, never from the JWT. Paired devices keep `paired_device_id` and are re-checked on every
  request. The pairing flows under `/api/device-pairing/*` are unchanged.
- **Offline authorisation** is a safety property and stays in Rust: `AuthzCacheHandle`,
  `RevocationCacheHandle`, `is_action_offline_required`, `verify_jwt`. Native code calls them;
  it never re-implements them.
- **Module gating**: `requiredPermissions` (all of), `requiredAnyPermissions` (any of), the
  `super_admin`/`hospital_admin` bypass, `appCodes` per surface, and module order (which
  decides where a role lands on launch).
- **Secrets**: Keychain `WhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly` / Android Keystore; the node sync secret
  is never logged.
- **The LAW docs' substance**: 44pt / 48dp targets, virtualised lists, teardown of every timer
  and socket, an error boundary per screen and last-good render, ≤200 MB and ≤2.5 s cold start
  on mobile (≤120 MB / 4 s on TV), WCAG 2.2 AA, the ten form/keyboard rules, and the fixed
  emergency-code colours with the 1 Hz flash cap.
- **The acceptance suite**: `packages/e2e-mobile/src/journeys.ts` remains the catalogue; each
  journey is re-implemented as an XCUITest and a Compose UI test as its module converts, with
  `automationStatus` kept honest.

## Structure

```
apps/ios/            XcodeGen workspace: MedBrainsCore (UniFFI Swift + xcframework),
                     MedBrainsKit (auth, permissions, offline, pairing, notifications,
                     biometrics, scanner, forms), MedBrainsUI (tokens, HIG components),
                     app targets MedBrainsStaff, MedBrainsPatient, MedBrainsCamp, MedBrainsVendor
apps/android/        Gradle: :core (UniFFI Kotlin + .so via cargo-ndk), :kit, :ui,
                     :app-staff, :app-patient, :app-camp, :app-vendor, :app-tv
crates/medbrains-clinical-core/   UniFFI crate for the framework-free clinical logic that
                     lived in TypeScript (bcma, transfusion, queue-order, lab-qc, …), ported
                     with its tests — shared, never copied
scripts/generate_native_tokens.py  design-system tokens → Swift + Kotlin
```

Request and response models are hand-written per screen from `packages/types`; the
`check-types` contract is extended to both native trees. `docs/openapi.json` supplies paths
and required permissions only.

## Platform rules

**iOS.** System containers only, so the iPhone Duo layout is inherited: `TabView`,
`NavigationStack` and `NavigationSplitView` for list-and-detail, `ToolbarItemGroup` with a
`Label(title, systemImage:)` on every item and visibility priorities, no fixed widths, safe
areas everywhere, size-class-driven layout, Dynamic Type, accessibility labels on every
icon-only control, reduced motion honoured. Xcode 26.6 ships no iPhone Duo simulator;
adaptivity is verified on iPad split view and large-phone landscape until one exists.

**Android.** `MaterialExpressiveTheme` fed from the tokens, `NavigationSuiteScaffold` and
`WindowSizeClass` for foldables, edge-to-edge with IME insets on forms, 48dp targets,
expressive components (button groups, FAB menu, loading indicator) where Paper equivalents
were used.

**TV.** Compose for TV, an obvious focus state, 48dp overscan, WebSocket-driven boards with a
last-good render, never a blank board.

## Order of conversion

0. This RFC, the LAW-doc amendments, tooling (Android Studio, JDK 17, cargo-ndk, Rust cross
   targets, uniffi-bindgen), the Rust core built as an xcframework and Android `.so`s.
1. The two shells, proven by signing in as the e2e nurse and seeing exactly the nurse's
   modules, offline included.
2. Mobile-Nurse. 3. Mobile-Doctor. 4. Mobile-Patient. 5. Pharmacist, LabTech and the remaining
   staff modules, with the four phlebotomy screens salvaged from `apps/mobile`. 6. Mobile-Camp.
7. TV. 8. Decommission: `apps/mobile` first, then each React Native app as its native pair
   reaches parity on the journey catalogue, then `packages/mobile-shell`, `packages/ui-mobile`
   and `packages/uniffi-rn-plugin`.

Each phase lands as one focused PR after the full gate, verified on simulator and emulator
with screenshots of every screen.

/**
 * Admission → nursing — the 24-hour initial assessment NABH requires.
 *
 * Rostering a nurse on a ward and admitting a patient to a bed on that ward
 * are two modules' actions. The linkage is a nursing task that appears on the
 * admission, assigned to the ward's charge nurse, due a day later. Until the
 * roster screen existed nothing could write nurse_shift_assignments, so this
 * task was never raised on any admission.
 *
 * The negatives are the point: no roster ⇒ no task (writing an unassigned
 * task would sit on nobody's list and make the register look attended to);
 * the same nurse twice on one shift ⇒ 409; a nurse rostering herself ⇒ 403.
 *
 * The table-only half — dispatching the event twice and proving one row — is
 * in crates/medbrains-server/tests/linkage_admission_assessment_test.rs.

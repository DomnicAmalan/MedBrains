//! The transfusion as it happens at the bed.
//!
//! Two tables carry the word "transfusion" and they are not the same record.
//! `transfusion_records` is the bank's issue register — which unit left stock
//! for which patient — and every handler in `lib.rs` reads and writes it.
//! `transfusions` is the bedside chart: the admission, the bag hanging on the
//! pole, who checked the patient against it, and whether the patient reacted.
//!
//! Only the second one has ever mattered to `transfusion_observations`, whose
//! foreign key points at it. But nothing in the codebase inserted a row into
//! `transfusions` — not one INSERT — so the observation endpoint could not
//! succeed for any id a client was able to obtain, and the first fifteen
//! minutes of a transfusion, which is when a fatal ABO reaction presents,
//! could not be recorded at all. The print template for the monitoring chart
//! reads this table too, and had nothing to print.
//!
//! # Why these are nursing permissions
//!
//! The observation endpoint next door is gated on
//! `blood_bank.transfusion.create`, held by `blood_bank_tech` and by nobody
//! who stands at a bed. The bank issues a unit; a nurse hangs it and watches
//! the patient. Reusing the bank's code for the bedside act would have meant
//! granting ward nurses the issue register to let them chart a set of vitals.
//!
//! # The checklist is enforced here, not drawn
//!
//! Consent, compatibility, expiry and the two-person identity check are
//! conditions of starting, not boxes on a form. A UI can only decline to send;
//! a rule that lives on the server is one a second client cannot skip.

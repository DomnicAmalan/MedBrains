//! A nurse call nobody answers has to reach somebody (NABH CL-3).
//!
//! Escalation already existed as a *colour*. The ward board computed it on
//! read — amber past the tenant's first threshold, red past the second — and
//! that was the whole of it. Nobody was told. A charge nurse found out about
//! an unanswered call by happening to look at a screen, which is a
//! coincidence rather than a control, and at three in the morning there is
//! nobody looking at the screen.
//!
//! This pass tells them. Two tiers, the same thresholds the board uses
//! (`nurse_call_escalate_secs`, `nurse_call_supervisor_secs`), so the colour
//! on the wall and the notification in somebody's hand agree about when a
//! call went late.
//!
//! `acknowledged` does not stop the clock. A nurse pressing "Seen" has taken
//! the call, not answered it, and the same rule already governs
//! `is_open_nurse_call` in the shared core — the patient is still waiting.
